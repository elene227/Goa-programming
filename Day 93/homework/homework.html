            <h3>[Verse 1]
                I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
                It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
                I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
                But just don't
                I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
                Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
                I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
                Yeah, I know
                All I'm asking, baby
                </h3>

                Please, please, please
                Don't prove I'm right
                And please, pleasе, please
                Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
                Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
                I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
                Please, please, please (Ah)</h3>

            <h3>Well, I have a fun idea, babe (Uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
                I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
                And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
                I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really, really</h3>
