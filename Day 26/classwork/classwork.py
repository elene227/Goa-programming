# BUT WHAT IF?

# len()  -  გვიბრუნებს სიის ან სტრინგის სიგრძეს

# but what if we?

# but WHAT if we use list and type one string inside it and use len

# it will only print third awdf(what kind of name is awdf idk)


# NOW it time FOR INSERT yippyyy

# სიის კონკრეტულ ინდექსზე ამატებს ელემენტს - that means it adds element in specific index

# tf is pop do?

# NAW first lets see how can we use two funcs at the same time muhahah
